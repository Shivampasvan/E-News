                <p><b>New Delhi:</b>
                    The ban on the students' wing of Popular Front Of India over alleged terror activities will be challenged in court. The Centre had banned PFI yesterday after multiple raids and arrests of over 240 members..
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 1 </b>
                    The PFI and its affiliate organisations have been declared an "unlawful association" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the government said, citing the outfit's links with the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), Jamat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and Islamic State or ISIS, and said the PFI is involved in several criminal and terror cases.
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 2 </b>
                    The now banned outfit has been accused of raising funds, from both India and abroad, through hawala and donations as part of a "well-crafted criminal conspiracy". "With funds and ideological support from outside, it has become a major threat to the internal security of the country," said a Home Ministry order.
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 3 </b>
                    The ministry said the PFI has been involved in violent acts like, "chopping off the hand of a college professor in Kerala and cold-blooded killings of people associated with organisations espousing other faiths."
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 4 </b>
                    "Several criminal activities and brutal murders have been committed by PFI members over the past to create reign of terror in public mind," it said.
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 5 </b>
                    The Home Ministry said PFI and its affiliates have been indulging in unlawful activities "prejudicial to the integrity, sovereignty and security of the country", and that they have the potential to disturb public peace and communal harmony.
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 6 </b>
                    The PFI has been "pursuing a secret agenda to radicalise a particular section of the society", said the ministry, adding that the outfit shows "sheer disrespect towards the constitutional authority of the country".
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 7 </b>
                    Besides the PFI, organisations linked to it have also been banned. These are Rehab India Foundation (RIF), Campus Front of India (CF), All India Imams Council (AIIC), National Confederation of Human Rights Organisation (NCHRO), National Women's Front, Junior Front, Empower India Foundation and Rehab Foundation, Kerala.
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 8 </b>
                    Calling the ban "undemocratic" and "unconstitutional", the Campus Front of India -- students' wing of the PFI -- said they will challenge it in Supreme Court.
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 9 </b>
                    Three states - Karnataka, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh - have recommended a ban on the organisation, the ministry said. Junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra Teni said the decision to ban the PFI was taken based on evidence gathered by central agencies during the investigation
                </p>
                <p><b>Number : 10 </b>
                    PFI leaders and functionaries across 15 states were first raided on September 22, in a coordinated move by National Investigating Agency (NIA), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the state police, leading to over 100 arrests. The second round of nationwide crackdown on the organisation was carried out yesterday. Over 240 arrests have been made so far, officials said.
