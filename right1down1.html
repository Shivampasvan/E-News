                    <p><b>New Delhi :</b> At least ten people were killed and 41 were injured in a truck-bus collision in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday
                    <br><br>
                    Out of the injured, 12 were shifted to a trauma centre in Lucknow while the others are undergoing treatment at the district hospital.

                    In a video that has gone viral on social media, Lucknow Divisional Commissioner Roshan Jacob can be seen breaking down while interacting with the families of the injured. In the video, a teary-eyed Ms Jacob enquires about the health of a child injured in the accident while directing officials to ensure his treatment.
                    <br><br>
                    Born in Thiruvananthapuram, Ms Jacob is a 2004-batch IAS officer. She was under the spotlight two weeks ago when a video of her inspecting waterlogged streets of Lucknow went viral on social media.

                    According to UP Police, the accident took place on the Aira bridge on National Highway 730. A bus was on its way to Lucknow from Dhaurhara when it collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction.
                    <br><br>
                    President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi both expressed their grief and offered their condolences to the families of the victims.
                    <br><br>
                    "Deeply saddened by the news of the death of many people in a road accident in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh. I express my deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in the accident and the injured a speedy recovery," a message on the official Twitter handle of the President said.
