                <p><b>Singapore:</b>  Fighter jets escorted a Singapore Airlines plane to land at the city-state's international airport Changi on Wednesday after a passenger had made a bomb threat, Singapore's defence ministry said.
                    <br><br>
                    A 37-year-old male passenger on board the flight from San Franciso had claimed there was a bomb in his hand luggage, a statement from the ministry said. 
                    <br><br>
                    The bomb threat was subsequently found to be false, it said, adding the suspect had been arrested and police were continuing their investigations. 
                    <br><br>
                    Singapore police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
                    <br><br>
                    A spokesperson for Singapore Airlines said all other passengers and crew had disembarked normally at 0920 a.m. (0130 GMT), declining to give further details on the incident.
